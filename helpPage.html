    <h2>What's the goal?</h2>
    <div id="paragraph">In this game, you are in a hamster's skin (the one you choose!) and your mission is to succeed in escaping of your captivity.
        But for that, you have to cross most dangerous ways.
        <br/><br/>
        First of all, you need to get out of your master's house, specifically to avoid his bedroom.
        <br/><br/>
        If you make it, you're supposed to go through the city. Be careful, the traffic is particularly dangerous on public highways.
        <br/><br/>
        Finally, your last stage is your fate. You might end up walking in the heart of the forest and on your own. Will you succeed in finding your kind?

    <h2>How to play?</h2>
    <div id="paragraph">The first step is to launch the game by clicking on the button which appears in the middle of your screen. You're now ready to play
        to Hamster Drop!
        <br/><br/><br/>
        For the next step, you just have to choose the number of players wishing to take part in the game. You have the choice between two modes of game: 2 players
        or 4 players (for the moment, the 8 players mode isn't available, it will be in the next update, be patient!).
        <br/><br/><br/>
        When the mode is selected, all players have to choose their avatar and pseudo. Choose carefully, because the chosen hamster will represent you
        throughout the entire game!
        <br/><br/><br/>
        From now, the game can begin! To play, it's simple. Walk your mouse where you want and when it's hovering over the place where you wish to drop your
        hamster, just click. This one will on the various platforms. Your objective is to reach the basket situated right below your game screen. Good luck!
